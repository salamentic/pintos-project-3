---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for accessing the data
>> stored in the SPT about a given page.

Our process to this is quite simple. We firstly used a hash table to have our
SPT function, which allows for rather quick accesses at the cost of slower
insertions and deletions. 
When we perform an access to the SPT, the first thing we will need is the
virtual address of the page table being looked for (or other identifier if we
change it, the code is portable that way). This serves as the key for the hash
table we used for our SPT. We then call hash_lookup with the address as the
argument, which will then return us the corresponding page data we want from
the SPT, in a struct called 'page'. For this we had to implement functions
tthat allowed for hashing of the address and a function that compared two page
addresses and told us which one is the lesser of the two. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

We have a global lock for the frame table we use. Whenever a process needs a
new frame, they must necessarily add their entry to the frame table and
therefore, before the frame is allocated we simply acquire a global lock
(initialized to 1 in init.c). This way, whenever another process wishes to get
a new frame, it must also acquire the same lock and therefore waits till the
other frame has completed it's frame allocation before it can get it's own.
Using this simple lock synchronization we avoid most, if not all, race
conditions in one fell swoop.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

We used a hash table for out virtual-to-physical mappings. 
We had multiple choices for the given problem at hand. One consideration we
had in mind was simply an array, but the problems we had with it were that a
lot of space in between elements is wasted as more elements are freed. This
makes them a suboptimal data structure to use for us. 
The second choice we considered were lists. This actually works pretty well
memory-wise and provide extremely quick insertions and deletions, but the
thing with this was that, the accesses would turn out to be extremely slow.
For a problem as repetitive as virtual to physical mappings, we thought that
access time should take priority and so dropped this structure. 
Finally, we came to hash tables. These give us extremely fast accesses, access
to robust data storage using structs and gives generally fast insertions and
deletions except in case of hash collisions or an extremely large amount of
deletions, which can be fixed by a rehash at a certain point equating to the
same time as a single access using a list. This makes hash tables optimal for
us. 
We also considered bit vectors but these felt more useful and we did not
really know how to go about using those.

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

int dirty - We add a drty bit to the frame struct in frame table.

struct semaphore sema_page - A semaphore used to ensure synchronization in
page table.

int evicted - An int in the frame struct to show if the frame has been evicted
or not.

int paged_out - Used to see if this page is still in memory or not. In struct
page/ in SPT.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

Our code for doing so is straightforward. The replacement algorithm we use
frames is a simple (slightly modified) LIFO algorithm. 
The first thing we do is set up iteration on the hash table. Once that is
done, we go directly to the last element of our frame table and iterate
backwards from there on. We then check wether or not the access bit for the
page has been used. If it has, this makes the frame a possible victim for
eviction. Then we check if the dirty bit has also been set. If it has, we
simply evict the page out right away. If not, we check a certain number of
pages (To save time) say , 5, under the given page and see if any of them have
both their dirty and access bits set. If any has, then that page will be
evicted right away and we stop iteration. 
Eviction itself is rather simple since most of the process will probably be
done in palloc_get_page. We simply remove the frame and then, allocate a new
frame, and finally put it back into the frame table with the page it now
holds, if any. We might change this to simply reuse the frame for this instead
of actually letting go of it in the table.

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

When a process P obtains a frame that was previously, the process of changing
this is quite simple. The first thing we do is we change the page that is
being held in the given frame by installing proces P's own frame into the
frame being used. Then we update the SPT to reflect the same for the frame.
Then we finally update the frame table to point to the new page that is in it
and also update the owner PID in the frame struct for the frametable. 
Through this simple, succinct process we successfully hand over the frame from
Q to P quite completely.

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

The heuristic we developed for this purpose is a pointed for every element in the struct hash SPT, which is a supplementary page table. When this value is null, that indicates that the page being accessed is not a stack access, and therefore we should go through the normal page_fault procedure. If it is not in the SPT at all, we treat it as an invalid invalid virtual access.

If the stack pointer is not null, then the value stored in this pointer is going be the current position of the esp, indicating that this is a stack access. Before we do this, we run this address up or down, to ensure that we can check for a page. We can later add a check where we might see if the esp currently is not in the current page, and redirect the page fault into that page. For the scope of this question, we believe we do not have to explain this.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)
  The way we do VM synchronization is through semaphores for every page that
we use. This, allows for every page access (and through locks for the tables,
table access) to be protected from race conditions at the cost of more
complexity and risks of deadlocks. This though allows us to have a lot more
parallelism and reliability on the kernel side. 
  The way we prevent deadlocks in our design is a rather simple application of
deadlock prevention that we learned in class. When a process owns a page, it
does not prevent other processes from trying to access this page through page
faults or other methods. Therefore, deadlocks are mostly prevented this way
since the hold and wait clause is prevented in most cases. 
  We do realize though there might be other ways a deadlock might take place
and therefore the other consideration we were going to make was to have a
single semaphore for the page table access. This we realized has a lot more
disadvantages but might change to this if we find a case where we were
mistaken and deadlocks do actually take place due to something we missed.
  

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify

>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

To ensure this, we simply add synchronization into the mix. For every page, we
will add a semaphore entry in it's page table and therefore whenever it has to
perform modifications to it's page, it has to down the semaphore before
continuing (this method also works if we modify this to be a single semaphore
for all page acceses). This with an initialization to 1, allows for the pages to be
modified only by one process at a time. Therefore, during the eviction process
no other process can touch this page in any way and thereby preventing that
race condition.
This also prevents Q faulting the page back in, because we must have the same
synchronization taking place even then. Then, if Q wishes to fault the page
back in after the eviction takes place, we can simply 
if the page is
still in a frame (by using an evicted bit if we do not want to delete it from
the supplementary page table), and if not we just terminate the process or do
not fault at all, since this would then technically be an invalid memory
access as of now. We could also bring the page back in after the eviction,
although that mich cause inefficiency that we might want to avoid.
This whole process can also be simplified by changing the number of semaphores
from one per page to just one globally, which might help with deadlock (at the
cost of reduced parallelism) but does not change the functionality explained
above in any manner.

We take the former option and use page faults to bring back in pages, since
that allows for more functionality without having 'one-offs' of any kind. This
allows us to treat paged-out paging as a proper invariant and case independent
as much as possible. 
We gracefully handle invalid virtual addresses by having a sufficient amount
of checks in place to handle the given address. We first check in the SPT if
the address being accessed is a valid one at all, and if it is we check if it
had already been evicted earlier. If it has, we handle it based on our page
fault process which we have explained earlier in the document (Installing a
new set of data into a frame using the data pointer in the SPT for the given
frame). If the page was not in the SPT, we check again in the frame table to
make sure that we are not facing any error of kinds, and then finally
terminate the process since then the access is an invalid invalid virtual
address access.

We considered using the single lock system but ended up going with an approach
more towards multiple locks for synchronization. Although agreed, the
possiblity of deadlocks exists by having a lock for every page access and for
access to the frametable, it allows for way lesser race conditions and at the
same time allows for our system to function much more reliably and quickly
than in the case of a single lock, which would cause waits in cases where they
should not be an issue (frame access waiting for a frame access or frame
rehash, as an example). We feel that we have mechanisms to prevent deadlocks
in most cases (Deadlock prevention in our case i.e ensuring no conditions for
deadlocks are created by us the designers), and therefore allows for enough
safety that makes the usage of this system worth it. We feel that these
advantages it provides over the rather primitive single lock mechanism make
this a slightly risker but way,way more functional choice.
  In the end though, if deadlocks become too much of an issue we might switch
to the single lock method since our design is made such that we lose no
functionality while making this switch.



			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?
  I feel making the page table while not having any eviction process required
is a little redundant, since the purpose of the frame table is close to none
without eviction in play. 
  The other functionality I think was fine and decently hard enough to
implement.
  Nevertheless, we appreciate the reduced project length, as this time of year can be quite stressful, so the reduced workload is helpful.
The project seems rather reasonable to complete, the majority of the problems seem like they have more freedom in terms of implementation, which should make it more enjoyable.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?
  Yeah. I feel this gave me a better insight into the whole mechanism of
paging and segmentation and how these structures can be implemented in actual
OS design. It was a very good experience to actually have to implement these
rather than just learn about them, as we do in a lot of other courses.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

The guidance given seems to be about the appropriate level to give. For previous projets, it has felt like too much information has been given out, but I did not feel like this was the case for this project so far.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

If the reduced worklad of project 3 is kept in the future, it will be helpful to have the modified design doc & tests that need to be completed ahead of time, and make these available.This will be very helpful.

>> Any other comments?
In the future I would definitely come back to this project to work on the
excluded parts and possibly the filesystems project too.
